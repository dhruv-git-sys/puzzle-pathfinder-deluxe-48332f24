## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an interactive **DFS (Depth-First Search) Backtracking Visualizer**, designed to help learners and enthusiasts understand the recursive nature of backtracking algorithms. It enables users to build custom grids, visualize recursive depth-first search, and grasp how backtracking undoes failed paths.

This visualizer brings to life fundamental concepts from **Discrete Mathematical Structures**, including graph theory, recursion trees, and search algorithms.
